Make the Script Executable:
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Make the script executable:


chmod +x remove_duplicates.sh

Run the Script:
Execute the script:


./remove_duplicates.sh

This approach ensures that the script runs as a single unit, reducing the risk of errors and making it easier to manage.
